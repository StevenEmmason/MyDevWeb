                <p>The mothman is humanoid entity with wings on it's back. While called a Mothman, accoriding to some sightings it's appearance is more akin to a giant owl. It is approximatly 7 metres tall with a wing span of 10 metres. It also has a pair of large glowing red eyes which seem to cause extreme fear and distress in anyone who sees them. It has also been reported to fly at high speeds, persuing a car at speeds over 100mph as well as being able to shoot straight up into the sky at great speeds as well.</p>
                <p>Most sightings have been in West Virginia, USA, but these would stop on December 15th, 1976, when the silver bridge collapsed, killing 46 people. However there have been sightings of similar entities around the world.</p>
                <p>The connection with the Silver Bridge has led many to believe that the entity is a harbinger of death, either warning or worse bringing calamity. Official views on the matter state that it was nothing more than a very large bird such as the sandhill crane, though there are problems with this explanation.</p>
